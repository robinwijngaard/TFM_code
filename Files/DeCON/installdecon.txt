Change route to R v 3.1.2 in setup.sh:
	
	/home/robin/Downloads/R-3.1.2/bin/Rscript

Run setup.sh script:
	bash setup.sh


Add manually missing packages in the route: /home/robin/Documents/Project/TFM_code/DECoN-master/Linux/packrat/src (download from CRAN)
	VGAM (0.9-8)
	digest (0.6.8)
	scales (0.2.4)
	ggplot2 (1.0.1)

Reference genome:

DeCON requires the reference genome in a fasta file with the following headings: >1, >2... Therefore, i've created a new reference genome, only containing chr files from UCSC and changing headings by:

	cat chr??.fa > hg38.fa
	sed -i "1s/.*/>N/" chrN.txt

To run scripts from decon, its necessary to:
	Run from the DeCON directory (cd in bash script)
	Use R-3.1.2 version adding: /home/robin/Downloads/R-3.1.2/bin/Rscript
	Ref genome & bed files without "chr"
