version 1.6.0: (2013-03-05)

- switched from X*beta to exp(X*beta) for modeling the expected read depth

version 1.2.0: (2012-02-26)

- support for multisample projects: distribute sample segmentation across workstations, compile results and plot CNVs across samples (see vignette for a reworked example)

- log odds ratios for CNV segments using the fitted distribution of counts for the predicted and normal state

- strand-aware read starts and duplicate read removal for counting reads from a BAM file in genomic ranges

- functions for generating background read depth and calculating GC content
