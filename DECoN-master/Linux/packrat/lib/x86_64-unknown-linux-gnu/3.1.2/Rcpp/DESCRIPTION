Description: The 'Rcpp' package provides R functions as well as C++
    classes which offer a seamless integration of R and C++. Many R
    data types and objects can be mapped back and forth to C++
    equivalents which facilitates both writing of new code as well as
    easier integration of third-party libraries. Documentation about
    'Rcpp' is provided by several vignettes included in this package,
    via the 'Rcpp Gallery' site at <http://gallery.rcpp.org>, the paper
    by Eddelbuettel and Francois (2011, JSS), and the book by
    Eddelbuettel (2013, Springer); see 'citation("Rcpp")' for details
    on these last two.
