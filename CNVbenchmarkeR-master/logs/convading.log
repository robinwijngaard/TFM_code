Argument "" isn't numeric in numeric lt (<) at
	/home/robin/Documents/Project/TFM_code/CoNVaDING-master/CoNVaDING.pl line 1342 (#1)
    (W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator
    that expected a numeric value instead.  If you're fortunate the message
    will identify which operator was so unfortunate.
    
    Note that for the Inf and NaN (infinity and not-a-number) the
    definition of "numeric" is somewhat unusual: the strings themselves
    (like "Inf") are considered numeric, and anything following them is
    considered non-numeric.

    (W uninitialized) An undefined value was used as if it were already
    defined.  It was interpreted as a "" or a 0, but maybe it was a mistake.
    To suppress this warning assign a defined value to your variables.
    
    To help you figure out what was undefined, perl will try to tell you
    the name of the variable (if any) that was undefined.  In some cases
    it cannot do this, so it also tells you what operation you used the
    undefined value in.  Note, however, that perl optimizes your program
    and the operation displayed in the warning may not necessarily appear
    literally in your program.  For example, "that $foo" is usually
    optimized into "that " . $foo, and the warning will refer to the
    concatenation (.) operator, even though there is no . in
    your program.

    (W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator
    that expected a numeric value instead.  If you're fortunate the message
    will identify which operator was so unfortunate.
    
    Note that for the Inf and NaN (infinity and not-a-number) the
    definition of "numeric" is somewhat unusual: the strings themselves
    (like "Inf") are considered numeric, and anything following them is
    considered non-numeric.

  - in 'x': 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, Y
  - in 'y': X
  Make sure to always combine/compare objects based on the same reference
  genome (use suppressWarnings() to suppress this warning).
