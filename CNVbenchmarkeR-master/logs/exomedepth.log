Correlation between reference and tests count is 0.9994
To get meaningful result, this correlation should really be above 0.97. If this is not the case, consider the output of ExomeDepth as less reliable (i.e. most likely a high false positive rate)
Optimization of the choice of aggregate reference set, this process can take some time
Number of selected bins: 427
