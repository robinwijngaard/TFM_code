Now fitting the beta-binomial model on a data frame with 1486 rows : this step can take a few minutes.
Now computing the likelihood for the different copy number states
Correlation between reference and tests count is 0.99922
To get meaningful result, this correlation should really be above 0.97. If this is not the case, consider the output of ExomeDepth as less reliable (i.e. most likely a high false positive rate)
